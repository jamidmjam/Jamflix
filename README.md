## ⚙️ Build & Deploy with Ant

### 📦 To compile & package the WAR:
```bash
ant war

🚀 To build, deploy to Tomcat, and restart:

ant redeploy

	Tomcat is expected at /opt/tomcat9. You can change this in build.xml.

🧪 Demo Users (In MySQL)

Username	Password	Role
user1	password	free
user2	password	premium

Use these to test different access levels.
